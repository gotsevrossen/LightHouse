# Native Windows deployment

Build from an x64 Windows development checkout (Node/npm and uv required):

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File packaging/windows/build.ps1
```

The build installs Inno Setup with winget if needed, builds the existing React
app, bundles an isolated Python 3.13 runtime and locked backend dependencies,
and produces `dist/LightHouse-Setup.exe`. Target machines do not need Python,
Node, Git, uv, WSL, Docker, Zeek, or Wazuh. Internet access is required during
installation for the sensor packages, rules, Ollama, and model download.
Windows 10 22H2 or newer, x64, is required.

Double-click the EXE and approve Windows elevation. The free Npcap installer
has its own interactive wizard. Enable WinPcap compatibility mode. All other
dependency setup runs unattended. The setup then installs Suricata's official
MSI, Sysmon with the SwiftOnSecurity starting configuration, Ollama, and
`phi4-mini`. It enables Security logon success/failure auditing.

**The free Npcap edition cannot install silently.** This is a missing feature,
not a switch that LightHouse can enable. See the [Npcap vendor guide](https://npcap.com/guide/npcap-users-guide.html).
For a completely unattended install, preinstall Npcap or supply an OEM installer
path in `C:\ProgramData\LightHouse\config\windows.json` under
`NpcapOemInstaller`. Then run, from an elevated terminal:

```powershell
.\dist\LightHouse-Setup.exe /VERYSILENT /SUPPRESSMSGBOXES /NORESTART /LOG="C:\Temp\LightHouse-setup.log"
```

Absent Npcap/OEM, silent setup fails explicitly and does not open a hidden driver
wizard. On an incomplete install, correct the reported cause and rerun the EXE.
The application payload may already be installed, but that is not a running stack.

## Files, credentials, and services

- Application and dashboard: `C:\Program Files\LightHouse`.
- Database: `C:\ProgramData\LightHouse\lighthouse.db`.
- Operator configuration: `C:\ProgramData\LightHouse\config\windows.json`.
- Sysmon rules: `C:\ProgramData\LightHouse\config\sysmon.xml`.
- Suricata configuration/rules/EVE: `config\suricata.yaml`, `rules`, and `suricata\eve.json` below the data directory.
- Event Log checkpoints: `C:\ProgramData\LightHouse\state`.
- Model storage: `C:\ProgramData\LightHouse\models`.
- Installer transcript: `C:\ProgramData\LightHouse\logs\install.log`.
- Last setup result: `C:\Program Files\LightHouse\setup\last-result.txt`.
- Initial `admin` password: `C:\ProgramData\LightHouse\logs\LightHouse-API.stdout.log` (including rotated copies).

Read the credential log using an elevated editor/terminal. The existing generated
password banner and mandatory first-login password change are unchanged. Data,
configuration, model storage and logs have an Administrators/SYSTEM-only ACL.
API startup initializes the database before ingestion starts, so the credential
banner is in the API log. Repair preserves accounts and does not reset passwords.

NSSM registers these automatic LocalSystem services, with restart-on-failure and
rotating stdout/stderr logs under the data directory:

| Service | Command / responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| LightHouse-API | `python -m uvicorn triage.api:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000` |
| LightHouse-Ingestion | `python -m triage.main tail` |
| LightHouse-Suricata | Native Suricata packet capture and EVE output |
| LightHouse-Ollama | `ollama serve`, using port 11435 and shared model storage |

Ollama uses a dedicated loopback port so its service does not compete with a
user's tray application on 11434. The API/dashboard is at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
NSSM's service environment supplies all application settings; no user PATH or
shell activation is required. No inbound firewall rule is added.

## Network configuration and repair

First setup selects the IPv4 default-route adapter and its subnet. Review
`HomeNet` and `CaptureInterface` before relying on coverage, particularly on
machines with multiple adapters or a VPN. A host's adapter only sees traffic
available to that host/interface; full LAN monitoring requires an appropriate
mirror/TAP arrangement.

Example `windows.json` (use your real adapter GUID and subnet):

```json
{
  "HomeNet": "192.168.1.0/24",
  "CaptureInterface": "\\Device\\NPF_{YOUR-ADAPTER-GUID}",
  "SuricataDir": "C:\\Suricata",
  "Model": "phi4-mini",
  "ApiPort": 8000,
  "OllamaPort": 11435,
  "NpcapOemInstaller": ""
}
```

Rerun setup after changing the JSON. It stops only the LightHouse services before
updating files, preserves the database/config/checkpoints/models, updates service
settings in place, reapplies the existing Sysmon XML, regenerates Suricata YAML
from the vendor file and JSON, validates it with `suricata -T`, and starts services
in dependency order. ET Open's currently published Suricata 7.0.3 rule archive is
used with Suricata 8; setup validates the resulting rules/configuration. Download
SHA256 values are recorded in the transcript and executable packages (including
cached copies) are checked against `packaging/windows/dependency-hashes.json`.
Ollama and an operator-supplied Npcap OEM installer must have a valid Authenticode
signature from the expected publisher. Sysmon is published only at a fixed
latest-release URL, so instead of a hash its `Sysmon64.exe` must carry a valid
Microsoft signature and the Sysinternals Sysmon product name. OEM files are copied
into the protected cache before verification/execution. NSSM is restored from its
verified archive on repair. The build also checks the embedded Python archive
against a pinned hash and installs Python wheels only with the hashes in `uv.lock`.
Downloads are verified before they enter the cache; a download or cached copy
that fails verification is discarded and fetched again on the next run.

Pins were established from the official vendor downloads on 2026-09-18. Updating
a pinned dependency requires reviewing its vendor release and updating the
committed hash; mismatches fail closed. Never update a pin simply to accept a
failed download. Rule/config text downloads are not executable
packages and continue to use HTTPS and the existing configuration validation.

The data tree receives a complete Administrators/SYSTEM-only DACL and trusted
ownership, including existing children. Setup rejects reparse points, untrusted
ownership, and preexisting untrusted write permissions (including generic-rights
entries) before consuming files. SYSTEM and Administrators are trusted owners.
When setup runs with a full, unsplit admin token (the built-in Administrator, or
UAC turned off), the account running it is trusted too: such accounts own what they
create and never run reduced-rights programs. Elevated UAC admins are not, since
their normal programs run as the same account without admin rights. At the end of every run, successful or
not, setup hands what it created to Administrators so any administrator can repair.
A rejection is shown in the setup error and `last-result.txt`; it happens before
`install.log` is opened. If rejected, preserve the old tree separately and
reinstall into a clean location; do not blindly copy potentially modified
configuration or cached executables back.

Uninstall removes the four LightHouse service registrations and application
payload. It preserves data and the separately installed Npcap/Suricata/Sysmon/
Ollama dependencies; it does not change auditing back or remove shared drivers.
Installation is repairable, but does not offer transactional rollback of vendor
installers. Honor a dependency's reported reboot requirement.

## Ingestion configuration

| Environment variable | Windows default |
| --- | --- |
| LIGHTHOUSE_SURICATA_PATH | `C:\Suricata\log\eve.json`; installer overrides to ProgramData |
| LIGHTHOUSE_SYSMON_CHANNEL | `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational` |
| LIGHTHOUSE_SECURITY_CHANNEL | `Security` |
| LIGHTHOUSE_EVENT_STATE_DIR | `C:\ProgramData\LightHouse\state` |
| LIGHTHOUSE_MODEL | `phi4-mini` |
| LIGHTHOUSE_OLLAMA_URL | `http://localhost:11434`; installer overrides to port 11435 |

Set a channel/path to an empty string to disable that input. Windows ignores
`LIGHTHOUSE_WAZUH_PATH` and `LIGHTHOUSE_ZEEK_PATH`. Linux keeps its existing file
sources, environment variables, commands and model default.

Sysmon/Security events use the existing Wazuh-compatible host-alert shape and
therefore retain `source=wazuh` in the existing dashboard/API. Native provider,
channel, Event ID, record ID and event data are retained in `raw.data.win`; no
Wazuh process runs. All Sysmon events are accepted. Security events include
4624, 4625, 4648, 4672, 4720, 4726, 4732 and 1102. Routine activity has a low
sensor floor; failed logon and account changes are medium; audit clearing and
Sysmon process tampering are high. The model can raise these floors as before.

First Event Log startup follows new events. Later starts resume saved record
positions, advancing only after successful processing. Log clear/rollover is
detected using both record ID and timestamp and replays retained records.
Normal downstream deduplication still applies. Failures are logged and retried.
Windows inputs add a hash of event-specific evidence (commands, images, accounts,
target paths, remote addresses) to their deduplication key, preventing unrelated
activity on the same host from being suppressed. Per-occurrence values (process and
logon IDs/GUIDs, source ports, timestamps, DNS answers) are excluded, so repeats
of one activity, such as a password-guessing burst, still collapse into one alert.
The detector rule ID stays readable. Event 1102 accepts the actual Eventlog provider and preserves UserData.

The installer probes both Event Log channels right after installing Sysmon (before
the model download) and waits for fresh reader health reports from the newly
started ingestion service. A reader reports `ok` once it has read its channel,
without waiting for the model to triage a backlog; after a processing failure it
stays `error` until an event is processed. Unchanged status is refreshed every
30 seconds. Analysts/admins can inspect `GET /api/advanced/ingestion`; missing,
failed, stopped or stale readers report `ok: false`. Off Windows no Event Log
readers run, so it reports `ok: true` with no channels. These reports cover Event
Log access/processing, not proof of network capture or AI accuracy. Reader reports
expire after four minutes without progress.
Suricata accepts alert, flow, http, tls, dns and smb records. Its Windows reader
waits for file creation, handles partial lines, and reopens on rotation/truncate.
As with the original file tailer, it starts at EOF and has no persistent file
offset across service downtime. The event channels have independent readers.

## Validation status (2026-09-18)

- Backend suite: **74 passed**, including 21 Windows ingestion tests, an installer
  security regression suite, and authentication coverage for ingestion health.
- Installer guard tests cover ACL construction, unsafe ownership/write grants
  (including generic rights), reparse rejection with the specific reason, changed/
  missing hashes, unsigned files, wrong publishers and unsigned/corrupt Sysmon
  archives. The real Sysmon 15.22 archive passes the signer/product check. Download
  verification, cache rejection and re-download were exercised against local files.
  Applying protected ACLs and restoring ownership on an elevated installed tree
  remain unvalidated.
- React production build: passed; no UI or chat changes.
- Embedded Python: backend, bcrypt, uvicorn and pywin32 import smoke test passed.
- Bundled API/dashboard: health and HTML checks passed on two consecutive starts;
  the existing administrator password hash was preserved on restart.
- Native pywin32: successfully read the developer machine's Application channel.
- Suricata: official MSI downloaded/extracted; generated configuration and ET Open
  rule assembly verified against its vendor YAML. Live `suricata -T`/capture has
  not been validated because Npcap is not installed.
- Inno Setup: compiled to an actual EXE. An initial EXE was run on the development
  machine and installed the application payload, then reported incomplete
  dependency setup. No LightHouse services were created. Its dependency log is
  admin-protected; a later UAC request to inspect it was cancelled. The final
  build additionally returns a failing exit code and records dependency failure
  text in the Inno log and `last-result.txt`.
- **Full dependency installation, model pull, service startup, reboot survival,
  and end-to-end repair/reinstall have not been validated.**
- **No clean-machine or VM validation was performed.** All checks above used this
  Windows development machine. Do not interpret compilation as a successful
  clean-machine installation.
